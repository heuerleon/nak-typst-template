# ðŸŽ“ NAK Typst Template
This is a template for Nordakademie transfer papers written in the markup-like typesetting system [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). Typst is an alternative to LaTeX with a range of advantages such as faster compile times, a comprehensive scripting system similar to languages like JavaScript and user-friendly error messages.

There are separate files for English as well as German transfer papers. The format closely resembles the other official Nordakademie templates and has been used by myself for writing my transfer papers.

You can find **example** files of how this template looks like in the [Releases](https://github.com/heuerleon/nak-typst-template/releases) of this repo.

## Setup

There are several ways to use this template for your transfer paper.

### Option A (manually clone the repo)

1. Install the Typst compiler on your local machine as described in the [Typst GitHub repo](https://github.com/typst/typst?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). I recommend using VSCode for working with Typst and installing the [Tinymist extension](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist).
2. Clone this template repo: `git clone git@github.com:leonheuer/nak-typst-template.git`
3. `cd nak-typst-template`
4. Watch source file: `typst watch src/main.typ` -> Changes in the file will be automatically recompiled
5. Open the `src/main.pdf` file to see the result PDF, which will be overwritten on change

You can commit your changes by creating your own upstream repo (e.g. GitHub) and changing the remote of your local repo to point to your own upstream repo.

### Option B (create your own repo directly)

This is a GitHub template, which means you can create your Repo based on this repository without forking it. After creating your repo, clone it and proceed with the steps as described.

### Option C (use the Typst online editor)

This option has the advantage that you don't need to setup your local IDE and dev environment.

1. Click on the green button "Code" in the top of this repo, and select the option "Download ZIP".
2. Unpack the zip file
3. Go to the [Typst Webapp](https://typst.app) and create a new empty file.
4. Open the files sidebar and click the upload icon. You can then choose your unpacked folder.
5. You can now click on the closed eye symbol next to the `main_en.typ` file (`main_de.typ` if you're writing in **German**). This will load your main file in the preview on the right.

## Writing your Transfer Paper

The core of this template is the `main_en.typ` file (`main_de.typ` if you're writing in **German**). Here you can:
- Fill the data for the cover template
- Add new abbreviations
- Add formatting and page setup
- Most importantly, add your content

Reusable code should be extracted into components inside the `components` directory. Define your components as functions that you call in the main file. This template comes with a few basic components:
- **Acronym**: a modified version of the [Acrostiche](https://typst.app/universe/package/acrostiche/) extension. Mainly changes the output format to a more beautifully styled table.
- **Code**: for importing code from a file and formatting it as a block with syntax highlighting
- **Cover**: designed to resemble the original cover template for Nordakademie transfer papers
- **Header**: designed to resemble the original header for Nordakademie transfer papers
- **Outline**: functions for printing outlines such as List of Tables, Table of Contents etc. that apply some basic formatting
- **Tables**: some styled table functions that I developed while writing my own transfer papers

Add any images, code source files or other kinds of resources that you want to include in your transfer paper, in the `res` directory.

The bibliography file also lies in the `res` directory and uses the [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.com/g/bibtex-format/) format. You might know it when coming from LaTeX, and you can use your current setup (e.g. export via Zotero) or copy your existing bibliography when switching from LaTeX.

**Everything else can be done by using Typst built-in features. Additional formatting or tutorials can be found in the [Typst Docs](https://typst.app/docs/).**
