== Code blocks

=== Inline code
Adding `rbx` to `rcx` gives
the desired result.

What is ```rust fn main()``` in Rust
would be ```c int main()``` in C.

=== Code block
This is an example for a simple code block:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
```

#pagebreak()

= Images
The following will show how images look like in the document. This uses the default figure and image functions of Typist. Nothing special, you can configure stuff like height and caption.

#figure(
  image("../res/example_image.jpg", height: 9cm),
  caption: "Interesting image of Korea because I love Korea and I want to showcase images",
)
